Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is associated with chronic kidney disease.,Event
Our results show that GraphMERT yields higher factuality and validity of triples than LLM-based KG extraction,Event
Gary Marcus published Deep learning: A critical appraisal in 2018,Event
Scarcity of diverse high-quality data at the scale required by LLMs is a key barrier to clinical LLM deployment,Event
the selected triples align with the target domain and identify triples most relevant to the context,Event
Most KG embedding models operate on local triple patterns,Event
We do not hard-code any domain-specific parameters to the proposed GraphMERT pipeline.,Event
Missing key tokens required for high-quality tail completion,Event
IGF-1 is associated with diabetes,Event
GraphMERT depends on a helper LLM for tail combination which introduces occasional incompleteness,Event
A higher optimal β strengthens the importance of cross-document understanding for triple generation which is not possible in LLM-generated KGs,Event
Auditable and editable KGs can serve as a persistent knowledge base in sensitive domains,Event
Filter generated triples by computing semantic similarity between each triple and its source sequence with threshold β,Event
simplicity of triples can hide poorer coverage and loss of domain details,Event
transformers currently dominate the NLP field,Event
H-GAT fuses relation embeddings into semantic graph nodes,Event
naringenin is a flavonoid,Event
We evaluate the extracted KG by applying GraphRAG to the filtered benchmarks and assess accuracy based on the model's success rate in answering the questions,Event
Graham Neubig published Better synthetic data by retrieving and transforming existing datasets in August 2024,Event
"To enable training of a transformer on graphical input, the graph structure must either be encoded into the input or the attention module must be modified.",Event
The shortest path for every node pair is calculated using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm,Event
We train GraphMERT for 25 epochs on four H100 GPUs with BF16 precision,Event
Fibrosis occurs,Event
we measure relation diversity by the number of unique triples that contain the relation,Event
Removing knowledge from LLMs requires complex interventions and sophisticated strategies,Event
Recent work shows GraphRAG outperforms vector RAG and HybridRAG on arXiv datasets with superior factual accuracy and reasoning,Event
Compute a semantic relevance score for each triple with respect to the original input sequence,Event
Removal of either dropout or H-GAT leads to a substantial decrease in accuracy,Event
The retrieved data sources are ranked and filtered to fit within a single predefined context window,Event
"Marvin Hofer, Daniel Obraczka, Alieh Saeedi, Hanna Köpcke, and Erhard Rahm. Construction of knowledge graphs: Current state and challenges.",Event
"Lee Sharkey, Bilal Chughtai, Joshua Batson, Jack Lindsey, Jeff Wu, Lucius Bushnaq, Nicholas GoldowskyDill, Stefan Heimersheim, Alejandro Ortega, Joseph Bloom, and others published 'Open problems in mechanistic interpretability' in 2025 on arXiv.",Event
"For each KG, triples with heads containing 'insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)' and 'glucocorticoid receptor (GR)' were retrieved for human-inspectable samples",Event
Insulin-like growth factor 1 level is associated with growth hormone treatment.,Event
"Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton published Deep learning in Nature in 2015",Event
fine-tuning adapts models to the domains they are trained on,Event
"Traditional AI research overwhelmingly associates reasoning with purely symbolic systems, such as expert systems or logic-based AI.",Event
The embedding block fuses every leaf token embedding with its relation and all its head tokens via H-GAT,Event
has_laterality was given as an example of a relation with very few possible tails,Event
The LLM KG shows more relation misuse and ontology violations reflected in a greater share of maybe and no verdicts,Event
We can compare entity names using standard set-based similarity metrics,Event
Symbolic and neural learning algorithms: An experimental comparison was published in 1991,Event
Neural approaches rely on multidimensional embeddings and approximate knowledge grounding,Event
Naringenin is a flavonoid,Event
LLMs are brittle with respect to prompts and instruction fine-tuning does not fully address this problem,Event
prompt-based KG distillation from an LLM's weights does not provide source attribution,Event
Even with 75% of the seed knowledge removed GraphMERT still outperforms the baseline LLM KG by 3.86%,Event
Emergent abilities of large language models was published in 2022,Event
High-quality data are scarce,Event
"Leaves of the same root are connected, introducing a shortest-path linkage between them",Event
This process begins by identifying a set of entities within the KG that are semantically related to the user query.,Event
